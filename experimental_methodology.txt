Experiment 1:
- Complete failure
- The fish cunningly exploited the predator's weaknesses
    - Best fish after 15 generations (cohesion, separation, alignment, fear):
        -0.2811443860160044,0.1898170757667651,-0.058644418192723376,-1.0577028509009756,3000
    - They learned to swim away from each other (negative cohesion and alignment)
    - They learned to swim **towards** the predators (negative fear?!?!)
- The predator was too clumsy, so the fish learned to face it 1v1
- The predator has a hard time tracking down individual fish using this strategy 
- Let's make the predator more agile...
